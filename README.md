# Weather Dashboard ![License](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=MIT&message=license&color=red)


## Description 
I have created a weather dashboard application that allows the user to search weather information by city. When the user enters a city and clicks the search button, they are presented with a snapshot of current weather information along with an icon to indicate weather conditions. Additionally, they receive a 5 day forecast that includes the date, temperature, humidity, and a weather icon.
